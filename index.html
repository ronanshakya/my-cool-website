                        <p title="This is a tooltip">
                            Starting from scratch in the world of web development was a bit overwhelming.
                            But I have begun to piece the fundamentals together. Learning to structure web pages
                            and style them was only the first part. But recently, I learned about semantic HTML
                            and it has been an eye-opening experience. It's been a journey full of challenges,
                            but I've gained the confidence to build more complex pages with each new challenge.
                            Web development has proven to be both a challenging puzzle and a rewarding creative
                            outlet, opening doors to a new world I never thought I could navigate.

                        <p>
                            After spending all of my life in my parents' home, for the first time in my life,
                            I have begun my journey towards independence. And I am here now, in Canada. I am
                            determined to start my professional career as a Web Developer. I am a student right now,
                            but I believe your professional career starts earlier than your first job. My friends
                            from highschool have also told this to me. Internships, class projects, and side-projects
                            contribute to a student's portfolio. I am excited to see what challenges lie in front of me
                            and I am definitely prepared to face them. Wish me luck!

                        <p>
                            As a spoiled brat from Kathmandu, Nepal, I never thought I'd find myself
                            in a kitchen, let alone in Canada, all alone. Back home, I was accustomed
                            to having my mum prepare exquisite meals. But here in Canada, I didn't have
                            my mum to rely on anymore. With reluctance, I started my journey of
                            self-discovery in the world of cooking. Armed with YouTube tutorials, and
                            video calls with my mum, and a newfound appreciation for independence, I began
                            experimenting in the kitchen. On thing I've learned so far is that cooking is
                            difficult, especially when you have to do it three times a day. I have a newfound
                            appreciation for my mum.
